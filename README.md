# What does the mod add?

## Medic
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Medic can give any player a shield that will make them immortal. Although, if The Medic dies, the shield will break.
The only exception is The Officer; they will still die if they try to kill a Crewmate.
The Medic's other feature shows when they find a corpse: they can get a report that contains clues to the killer's identity.
The type of information they get is based on a timer that can be configured inside the lobby.
